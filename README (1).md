## üìñ **Project Description**  
This project focuses on predicting cryptocurrency prices using machine learning techniques and visualizing the results on an interactive dashboard. The system is designed to help users better understand market trends and make data-driven decisions. Historical market data such as price and trading volume were processed, analyzed, and modeled using various machine learning algorithms.

## üöÄ **Instructions on How to Run the Code and Use the Dashboard**  
To run the dashboard, follow these steps:  
1. **Install Python** (version 3.7 or higher).  
2. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/selam-max/BT.git
   cd BT
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**:  
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook** for data analysis and model training:  
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
5. **Run the Dashboard** (if using Dash or Streamlit):  
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   The dashboard will open in your web browser. Use it to explore the data and model predictions interactively.
